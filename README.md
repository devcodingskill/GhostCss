# Ghost CSS Animation

This project demonstrates a fun and spooky ghost animation using HTML and CSS. The ghost floats up and down, has animated feet, and includes a shadow effect for added realism.

## Features
- **Floating Animation**: The ghost smoothly floats up and down using CSS keyframes.
- **Eyes and Mouth**: The ghost has animated eyes and a mouth for a playful look.
- **Feet Animation**: The ghost's feet are styled and animated to enhance the design.
- **Shadow Effect**: A shadow below the ghost scales dynamically to match the floating motion.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the ghost.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles and animates the ghost.

## How to Run
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Observe the animated ghost in action.

## Key CSS Animations
- **`@keyframes floaty`**: Creates the floating effect by translating the ghost along the Y-axis.
- **`@keyframes zoomy`**: Animates the shadow to scale dynamically.

## Customization
- Modify the colors in `style.css` to change the ghost's appearance.
- Adjust the `@keyframes` values to change the speed or range of the animations.
